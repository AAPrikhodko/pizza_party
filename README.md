Dear User,

Here is a front-end web application for online pizza ordering (test task) made with **React** and **Redux**.
The main features are the following. 

You may: 

- put the pizza you like into the cart and make an order
  Next to the Cart button you can find the counter of the quantity of pizzas in the Cart  
- increase or decrease the quantity of pizza items in the cart
- switch the currency between EUR and USD in the main page or in the cart
- log in with test users:

  e-mail: test1@test.com
  password: qwerty

  e-mail: test2@test.com
  password: qwerty

  e-mail: test3@test.com
  password: qwerty
  
- create your own account and the log in with it

webbApp link: https://best-pizza-in-the-world.netlify.app/ 

Plans for updates:

- to connect fake JSON server in order to save all the data (pizzas, users, order's history etc.) in the storage. 
  Also, it will allow the app not to lose the data (cart items, users, history order's history etc.) when you refresh the page
- to create API for connection to server (using middleware with axios library)
- to work on adaptive view
- to create some tests for this webApp


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
